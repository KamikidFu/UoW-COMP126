        <p style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; font-size:12px;">New Zealand general elections occur when the Prime Minister requests a dissolution of Parliament and therefore a general election. Theoretically, this can happen at any time, although a convention exists whereby Prime Ministers do not call early elections unless they have no reasonable alternative.</p>

<p>Elections always take place on a Saturday, so as to minimise the effect of work or religious commitments that could inhibit people from voting. Voting (the casting of ballots) happens at various polling stations, generally established in schools, church halls, sports clubs, or other such public places. Polling booths are also set up in hospitals and rest homes for use by patients. The 2005 election made use of 6,094 such polling stations. Voters may vote at any voting station in the country, but if they are voting outside their electorate, they would need to cast a special vote.</p>

<p>Advance voting is available in the two weeks before election day if voters are unable to get to a polling place in their electorate on election day. If voters cannot physically get to a polling place, they may authorise another person to collect their ballot for them.</p>

<p>Overseas voters may vote by mail, fax, internet or in person at NZ embassies.</p>
