Kia ora and welcome to the University of Waikato.
Roy Crawford, Vice Chancellor of the University of Waikato</p>
</div>

<div style="border: 3px groove blue;">
<p>We are now halfway through this very significant year as we celebrate our first 50 years and we look forward to welcoming you on campus and sharing the exciting journey you have ahead.</p>

<p>There is no better time to be enrolling at a university ranked in the top 50 in the world in our peer group.</p>
</div>

<div style="border-bottom:6px solid red; background-color:Yellow;">
<p>This year the University of Waikato has five subjects ranked in the top 150 in the world, with one - Education - ranked 46th in the QS Subject Rankings, released in February. The other four subjects, all ranked from 101-150, are Modern Languages, Economics and Econometrics, Law and Computer Science and Info Systems.</p>
</div>

<div style="border-bottom:6px solid Yellow; background-color:LightGreen;">
<p>Already this year we have hosted several successful events to mark our first 50 years but there are still many exciting developments ahead to ensure the next 50 years are even more memorable.</p>
</div>

<p>For those of you who are beginning your studies this semester, I know you will enjoy your time with us. Work hard, aim high and you will soon be joining the ever-growing list of alumni ensuring the University of Waikato name is highly respected on the world stage.</p>

<p>To further enhance our learning environment, we are constantly developing our campus and construction of the new multi-million dollar Law and Management building is progressing well. When completed, it will create a string of three iconic campus facilities with the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the bottom of campus, the Student Centre in the heart of the campus and the new <a href="#part1">Law and Management building</a> on Hillcrest Road.</p>

<p>The new building reflects the University's drive to provide a rich learning environment for our students.</p>

<p>We are a research-led university and the recent national quality evaluation exercise for research has confirmed our students have ready access to world-leading researchers. By enrolling at the University of Waikato you can be confident you will receive a world-class education and a student experience second to none.</p>

<p>We are New Zealand's connected university and we have strong relationships with organisations, institutions and groups around the world. We are also characterised by innovation, such as opening New Zealand's first cyber security lab and delivering New Zealand's first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).</p>

<p>It is that sort of leadership and innovation, coupled with our unique campus-based experience, which makes the University of Waikato the ideal place to begin your journey.</p>

<p>I am proud to lead a University which offers a dynamic learning environment for our diverse student population and I encourage you to make the most of your time with us in the University of Waikato family.</p>

<p>Professor Roy Crawford<br>

Vice-Chancellor</p>
