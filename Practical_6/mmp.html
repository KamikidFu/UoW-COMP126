     <h1>Electoral system of New Zealand</h1>

    <p>New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote - in 1893. This meant that theoretically, New Zealand had universal suffrage meaning all adults 21 years of age and older were allowed to vote. However, the voting rules that applied to the European settlers did not apply to Maori - and their situation is still unique, in that a number of seats in the New Zealand parliament are reserved exclusively for Maori. A further limitation is that since 2010, sentenced prisoners have been denied the right to vote. Historically, prisoners sentenced to a term of three years or more were not allowed to vote but in 2010, the National Government imposed a blanket ban on voting for all sentenced prisoners.</p>

<p>New Zealand has one House of Representatives, usually with 120 members, although the number can increase because of (generally) one or two overhang seats; depending on the outcome of the electoral process. The term of the New Zealand Parliament is set at three years. Whichever party (or combination of parties) wins the most seats at the general election becomes the Government. For most of its history, a first past the post system was employed at elections. In 1993 the country by referendum voted for mixed member proportional representation (MMP) and this was introduced into its political system in 1996.</p>
        
    <h2>Term of Parliament</h2>
    
    <p>Although Parliamentary elections are held every three years, this has not always been the case. In New Zealand's early colonial history, elections were held every five years - as established by <span class="acts">The New Zealand Constitution Act</span> of 1852. The term was reduced to three years in 1879 because of concerns about the growing power of central Government.</p>

<p>Since then, the term has been altered three times – mainly in times of international crisis. During the First World War it was extended to five years. In the early 1930s, it was pushed out to four years. This proved to be unpopular with the electorate and after the election of 1935, the term was reduced to three years again. It was extended to four years once again during the Second World War, but returned to three years afterwards. In 1956, the term of three years was 'entrenched' in the <span  class="acts">Electoral Act</span> which means that it can only be changed by achieving a majority in a national referendum or by a vote of 75% of all members of Parliament.</p>

<p>In 2013 the Government established an advisory panel to conduct a review of constitutional issues - including an examination of the term of parliament. Other issues discussed at public meetings held by the panel were the number of MPs New Zealand should have, whether a written constitution is needed, and whether all legislation should be consistent with the <span  class="acts">Bill of Rights Act</span>. Both Prime Minister John Key and Opposition leader David Shearer expressed support for an extension of the parliamentary term to four years. The main argument put forward in support of a longer term is that "Governments need time to establish and then implement new policies".</p>

<p>The last referendum on the term of parliament was in 1990 and found nearly 70% of the voters were opposed to extending the term. An opinion poll on the news website Stuff.co.nz in early 2013 found that of 3,882 respondents, 61% were in favour of changing to a four-year term.[5]</p>
    
    <h2>Maori seats</h2>
    
    <p class="mainLink">Main article: Māori electorates</p>
    
    <p>A unique feature of New Zealand's electoral system is that a number of seats in Parliament are reserved exclusively for Maori. However, this was not always the case. In the early colonial era, Maori could not vote in elections unless they owned land as individuals. European colonists were quite happy with this state of affairs because, according to NZ History online, "they did not think Maori were 'civilised' enough to exercise such an important responsibility". At the time, Maori were dealing directly with the Crown in regard to the Treaty of Waitangi and had little interest in the 'pakeha parliament'.</p>

<p>During the wars of the 1860s, some settlers began to realise it was necessary to bring Maori into the British system if the two sides were to get along. After much debate, in 1867 Parliament passed the <span  class="acts">Maori Representation Act</span> which established four electorates solely for Maori. The four Maori seats were a very minor concession; the settlers had 72 seats at the time and, on a per capita basis, Maori should have got up to 16 seats.[6] All Maori men (but not women) over the age of 21 were given the right to vote and to stand for Parliament.</p>

<p>Full blooded Maori had to vote in the Maori seats and only Maori with mixed parentage ('half-castes') were allowed to choose whether they voted in European electorates or Maori electorates. This dual voting system continued until 1975.[6] From time to time there was public discussion about whether New Zealand still needed separate seats for Maori - which some considered to be a form of apartheid. Maori were only allowed to stand for election in European seats (or general electorates) from 1967.</p>

<p>In 1985, a Royal Commission on the Electoral System was established. It concluded that "separate seats had not helped Maori and that they would achieve better representation through a proportional party-list system". The Commission recommended that if mixed member proportional (MMP) system was adopted, the Maori seats should be abolished. However, most Maori wanted to keep them and the seats were not only retained under MMP, their "number would now increase or decrease according to the results (population numbers) of the regular Maori electoral option". As a result in 1996 before the first MMP election, the number of Maori seats increased to five - the first increase in 129 years. In 2002, it went up to seven.[7]</p>
    
<h2>Developments in voting rights and eligibility</h2>
<h3>Secret ballot</h3>

<p>In European seats, the secret ballot was introduced in 1870.[7] However, Maori continued to use a verbal system – whereby electors had to tell the polling official which candidate they wanted to vote for. Maori were not allowed a secret ballot until 1938 and even voted on a different day. According to NZ History online: "Up until 1951 Maori voted on a different day from Europeans, often several weeks later." It was not until 1951 that voting in the four Maori electorates was held on the same day as voting in the general election.[8]</p>

<p>NZ History also states: "There were also no electoral rolls for the Maori seats. Electoral officials had always argued that it would be too difficult to register Maori voters (supposedly because of difficulties with language, literacy and proof of identity). Despite frequent allegations of electoral irregularities in the Maori seats, rolls were not used until the 1949 election."[6]</p>
    
<h3>Women's suffrage</h3>
<p class="mainLink">Main article: Women's suffrage in New Zealand</p>

<p>In early colonial New Zealand, as in most Western countries, women were totally excluded from political affairs. Led by Kate Sheppard, a women's suffrage movement began in New Zealand in the late 19th century, and the legislative council finally passed a bill allowing women to vote in 1893.[9] This made New Zealand the first country in the world to give women the vote. However, they were not allowed to stand as candidates until 1919, and the first female Member of Parliament (Elizabeth McCombs) was not elected until 1933[9] - 40 years later. Although there have been two female Prime Ministers (Jenny Shipley and Helen Clark), women remain somewhat under-represented in Parliament.[9] Following the election in 2011, 39 MPs (almost one third) were women. On a global ranking, New Zealand is 21st in terms of its representation of women in Parliament.[10]</p>
