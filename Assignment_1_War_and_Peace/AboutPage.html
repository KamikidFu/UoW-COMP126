    <p class="about"> War and Peace (pre-reform Russian: Война́ и миръ; post-reform Russian: Война́ и мир, translit. Voyná i mir) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It is regarded as one of the central works of world literature. War and Peace and Tolstoy's other major prose work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina">Anna Karenina</a> (1875–77), are considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievements. </p>

    <p class="about"> Tolstoy himself said that War and Peace was "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle". Large sections, especially in the later chapters, are philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>, "no single English novel attains the universality of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace." </p>

    <!--Other Translation version-->
    <h2 style="text-align:center" id="Translation"> Other Translation </h2>
    <p class="about">
    	<i>War and Peace</i> has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators Constance Garnett and Louise and Aylmer Maude knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoy’s often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. About 2 per cent of War and Peace is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later. Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French, Briggs uses no French, while Pevear-Volokhonsky and Amy Mandelker's revision of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.
