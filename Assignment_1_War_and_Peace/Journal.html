    <h2>Final Images Justification</h2>
    <hr>
    <div>
    	<p>The images used in my page want to show a first-bite of War and Peace. Due to the great book, it is too large to introduce it briefly. Therefore, I choose more common and easy-to-catch figures.</p>
        <p> In the cover page, the picture of dance invitation is aimed to form first interests to the book. It is peaceful, and the colour is illustrated nicely.</p>
        <p> In the about page, Leo's figure is put at first to make the impression of one of the great authors. Then, it shows two figures about wars happened and written in the book. Compared to the peaceful in cover page, this book truly narrates horrible wars.</p>
        <p> The background image in cover page which I processed with PhotoShop to make ten different book covers into one image and using mask to change the opacity.</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        	<img class="PicGroup2" src="img/psProcess.jpg" alt="PhotoShopProcess">
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <!--Typography choices (including font stacks)-->
    <h2> Font Families</h2>
    <hr>
    <div>
    	<p>The mainly used font family in paragraph, table of content page and about page is Lucida Grande, while with some other choices if the font is not supported like Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, DejaVu Sans, Verdana, sans-serif.</p>
    	<p> The heading part is used Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. Special technique used in font families as the cover page, the title of book, author's name and reading page's fonts selection are used online fonts from Google.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <!--Colour and layout choices-->
    <h2> Colour and Layout </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The colour mainly used is simply white background and black fonts. Because it is classic and for another reason, yes, if knowing more about CSS is better :-). However, in order to have a better reading experience, the colour <span style="background-color:#FBB915">#FBB915</span> is used.</p>
    <p> The layout of my page is mainly in the centre with nicely responsive design in CSS. Besides, some concepts are shown in my pages like table of content and reading page. But as so far we did not start JavaScript stuff so those concepts are left there without any functionality.</p>
    <br>
    
    <!--Inspection of the text for opportunities to improve it (e.g. emdashes,symbols, accents etc.)-->
    <h2>Inspection of Text Improvement</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Although it is an English translation version, it also has accents. Meanwhile, in about page, while introducing the author, the Russian characters are used. Those characters just can be placed in code and they show in browser well without any distortion. But according to the html tag of HTML5, we use <i>lang="en"</i>, so I think there may be better ways to deal with special character from other languages and accents.</p>
    <br>
    
    <!--Backup strategy and frequency-->
    <h2> Backup Strategy and Frequency</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Thanks to the new technique of cloud, I am not too nervous about file losing or not up-to-date. Despite this, I also use flash store disk to store my files when I finish coding in lab and continue coding in my home. Eventually, there are at least two copies of my assignment files in the cloud and in my USB stick after once coding my website.</p>
    <br>
    
    <!-- Process of making up-->
    <h2> Process of My Work</h2>
    <hr>
    <div>
    <p> Firstly, after reading this assignment, in my mind, I have a rough concept. Set up a new folder for all the stuff related to this point. The Structure is like:</p>
    <div  style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="img/process1_FolderStructure.png" alt="FolderStructure" id="struc">
    </div>
    <p> <i>0.Upload Assignment</i> is a collection of my assignment and making a final check in this folder. After check all the things work well, zip the folder and upload to Moodle. <i>1-5 folders</i> are what the assignment required, from cover page to process journal. I work separately, coding, checking, validating, and at last, copy to the 0. folder. <i>6-7. folders</i> are the things I added, <i>Materials folder</i> contains the pictures and any text I retrieved from the Internet. <i>ProcessFault folder</i> is to record the faults happened to my files after validated at W3C. They are what I need to fix up. Current.txt is a text file to record which step I am, however, I have to replace old stage by current information. The green tick marker is the current state in my cloud which means it is up-to-cloud.</p>    	
    </div>    
    <h3>Pages Design</h3>
    	<div style="text-align:center">
        <img class="PicGroup1" src="img/CoverDesign.jpg" alt="CoverDesign">
        <img class="PicGroup1" src="img/AboutDesign.jpg" alt="AboutDesign">
        <img class="PicGroup1" src="img/TableDesign.jpg" alt="TableDesign">
        <img class="PicGroup1" src="img/ReadDesign.jpg" alt="ReadDesign">
        <img class="PicGroup1" src="img/JournalDesign.jpg" alt="JournalDesign">
        <p> Defferent page designs in Cover, About, Table of Content, Start of Book, Journal respectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>Cover Page is simple to compose. As for the requirements, the title of page is clear just the book name also uses a beautiful font with literature and art mind. The picture is to reflect one part of "War and Peace", the peace part. A fancy dance party was on, a peaceful invitation from a gentleman to that lady. At the bottom of page is the navigation area. The background image is to show how great and common the book is, because there are lots of different book covers design and even in a variety of languages.</p>      
     	<p> In about page, my first concept is to put images in where I will introduce about the images. But I finally make Leo's picture at the front of page because as I said above, I want to make the great author bolder and express the first impression on that author. Then, I just follow different sections to introduce the book, the author, some translation and this e-book information</p>
        <p> As for table of content, I have a humanied function to help reader for locating where he or she start reading. Although I do not know any JavaScript things, I leave the textbox, radio thing because they are HTML5 where we may cover and further extend by self-study. </p>
        <p> Reading page has similar functional concept like table of content, but it is with a default setting of background, fonts and letter spacing etc,. It is aimed for more accessions of personalization and stylization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Coding my pages</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        	<img class="PicGroup2" src="img/Coding.JPG" alt="CodinginLab">
            <img class="PicGroup2" src="img/CodingNote++.JPG" alt="CodinginHome">
        </div>
        	<p> While I am coding my pages, I mainly use Dreamweaver CC 2015 in lab and Notepad++ in my home with personal computer. Both of softwares offer a pop windows for any attribute and draw different tag in different colour. However, I really appreciate Dreamweaver because I think it is more powerful than Notepad++ as it has a Split Coding Mode, which shows me what is going on my pages. But to test those make up knowledges, Notepad++ is better than Dreamweaver, because Notepad++ not to offer the basic HTML5 things like !DOCTYPE HTML when generate a new empty page.</p>
        
        <h3>Faults Fix</h3>
        <div style="text-align:center">
        	<img class="PicGroup2" src="img/About20160908.jpg" alt="AboutFault">
            <img class="PicGroup2" src="img/startOfBook20160908.jpg" alt="ReadFault">     
            <img class="PicGroup2" src="img/TableOfContent20160908.jpg" alt="TableFault">   
        </div>
        	<p> These are groups of faults that catched when I am about to finish one of pages by W3C validator. Once catched an error or a warning, I have to fix these all together. For example, when I copy the URL from Google Fonts, it already has a "|" symbol in URL. It works but not pass the validator, therefore, I replace the "|" to %7C. This point is learned in practicals.</p>
